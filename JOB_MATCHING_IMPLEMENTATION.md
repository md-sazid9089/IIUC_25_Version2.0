## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **React 18.2.0** - UI components
- **Framer Motion 10.16.16** - Smooth animations
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **React Hot Toast** - Notifications
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling with neon dark theme

### Backend Stack

- **Firebase Firestore** - NoSQL database
- **Firebase Auth** - User authentication
- Client-side scoring (no backend API needed)

### Algorithm Design

```
Match Score = (Skill Score × 60%) + (Experience Score × 20%) + (Track Score × 20%)

Skill Score:
  - Intersection of user skills and job requirements
  - Case-insensitive partial matching
  - Weighted heavily (60% of total)

Experience Score:
  - Exact match: 20 points
  - 1 level difference: 10 points
  - 2+ levels difference: 0 points

Track Score:
  - Same track: 20 points
  - Similar/related track: 10 points
  - Different track: 0 points
```

### Data Flow

```
User Profile (Firestore)
    ↓
[Fetch user data + jobs]
    ↓
Calculate Match Scores (Client-side)
    ↓
Sort by Score (Highest first)
    ↓
Render Job Cards with Visualizations
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Theme Integration

- **Neon Dark Theme** matching existing app design
- **Color Palette:**
  - Background: `#0B0E1C` (dark navy)
  - Cards: `#11152B` with purple borders
  - Primary: `#A855F7` (purple)
  - Accent: `#D500F9` (pink)
  - Gradients: Purple → Pink

### Visual Elements

- **Match Badge** - Circular with percentage, glowing border
- **Skill Tags** - Green (matched) / Red (missing)
- **Progress Bars** - Animated score breakdowns
- **Hover Effects** - Smooth transitions and glows
- **Icons** - Lucide icons for intuitive UI

### Responsive Design

- Mobile: Single column, stacked layout
- Tablet: 2-column grid for stats
- Desktop: Full feature layout with sidebars

## 📊 Database Schema

### Collections Structure

**users/{userId}**

```javascript
{
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  displayName: string,
  skills: string[],              // ["react", "javascript", "node.js"]
  experienceLevel: string,       // "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
  preferredTrack: string,        // "frontend" | "backend" | "fullstack" etc.
}
```

**jobs/{jobId}**

```javascript
{
  title: string,
  company: string,
  location: string,
  skillsRequired: string[],      // ["react", "typescript", "tailwind"]
  experienceRequired: string,    // "intermediate"
  track: string,                 // "frontend"
  description: string,
  applyLinks: {
    linkedin?: string,
    bdjobs?: string,
    glassdoor?: string
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live:

- [ ] Seed production Firestore with job data
- [ ] Update Firebase security rules for `jobs` collection
- [ ] Ensure users can update their profiles
- [ ] Test with various user profiles (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- [ ] Verify all apply links are valid
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Check performance with 100+ jobs
- [ ] Update job data regularly

### Firebase Rules Example:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /jobs/{jobId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;  // Authenticated users can read
      allow write: if false;  // Only admins via Firebase Console
    }
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation

- ✅ Client-side scoring (no API latency)
- ✅ Single Firestore query for all jobs
- ✅ Cached user profile data
- ✅ Efficient array operations
- ✅ Optimized re-renders with React

### Scalability Notes

- **Current capacity**: Handles 100-500 jobs efficiently
- **For 1000+ jobs**: Consider pagination or filtering
- **Optimization ideas**:
  - Add indices to Firestore
  - Implement virtual scrolling
  - Cache match results
  - Pre-calculate common scores

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented

- ✅ Protected routes (requires authentication)
- ✅ User data isolation (can only read own profile)
- ✅ Client-side validation

### Recommended

- Update Firestore security rules
- Sanitize user inputs
- Rate limiting on seeding endpoints
- Admin role checks for JobSeeder page

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Scenarios

**Test 1: High Match**

- Profile: React, JavaScript, Intermediate, Frontend
- Expected: 80%+ match with React Developer jobs

**Test 2: Low Match**

- Profile: Python, ML, Advanced, Data Science
- Expected: <40% match with Frontend jobs

**Test 3: Partial Match**

- Profile: HTML, CSS, Beginner, Frontend
- Expected: 40-60% with Junior positions, lower with Senior

**Test 4: Search & Filters**

- Search "react" → only React jobs
- Filter "Excellent" → only 80%+ matches

**Test 5: Apply Links**

- Click LinkedIn → opens correct URL
- Only shows buttons for existing links
