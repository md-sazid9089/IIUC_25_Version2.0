## 📊 Firestore Data Structure

### Users Collection (`users/{userId}`)

**Required fields for job matching:**

```javascript
{
  uid: string,
  email: string,

  // Job matching fields
  skills: string[],                    // e.g., ["react", "javascript", "node.js"]
  experienceLevel: string,             // "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
  preferredTrack: string,              // "frontend" | "backend" | "fullstack" | "mobile" | "devops" | "data science" | "qa"

  // Optional fields
  displayName: string,
  bio: string,
  education: string,
  location: string
}
```

### Jobs Collection (`jobs/{jobId}`)

**Required fields:**

```javascript
{
  title: string,                       // Job title
  company: string,                     // Company name
  location: string,                    // Job location
  skillsRequired: string[],            // e.g., ["react", "typescript", "tailwind"]
  experienceRequired: string,          // "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
  track: string,                       // "frontend" | "backend" | "fullstack" etc.
  description: string,                 // Job description (optional for display)
  applyLinks: {                        // Application links
    linkedin?: string,
    bdjobs?: string,
    glassdoor?: string
  }
}
```

## 🧮 Matching Algorithm

### Score Breakdown (100 points total)

#### 1. Skill Match (60 points)

```
skillScore = (matchedSkills / totalRequiredSkills) × 60
```

- **Matched skills**: User has the skill (case-insensitive)
- **Missing skills**: User doesn't have the skill

#### 2. Experience Match (20 points)

| Scenario             | Points | Note                          |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Exact match          | 20     | Same experience level         |
| 1 level difference   | 10     | Slightly over/under qualified |
| 2+ levels difference | 0      | Significant mismatch          |

**Experience levels hierarchy:**

```
beginner → intermediate → advanced
```

#### 3. Track Match (20 points)

| Scenario        | Points | Note                                 |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Exact match     | 20     | Same track                           |
| Similar track   | 10     | Related (e.g., frontend ↔ fullstack) |
| Different track | 0      | Unrelated fields                     |

**Similar tracks:**

- Frontend ↔ Fullstack
- Backend ↔ Fullstack
- Mobile: React Native, Flutter, iOS, Android
- DevOps: Cloud, Infrastructure, SRE
- Data: Data Science, ML, AI

### Match Level Classification

| Score Range | Level           | Color  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------ |
| 80-100      | Excellent Match | Green  |
| 60-79       | Good Match      | Blue   |
| 40-59       | Fair Match      | Yellow |
| 0-39        | Low Match       | Red    |

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update User Profiles

Users need to complete their profiles with required fields. You can:

**Option A: Update Profile Page**
Add form fields to `src/pages/Profile.jsx` for:

- Skills (array input)
- Experience Level (dropdown)
- Preferred Track (dropdown)

**Option B: Manual Firestore Update**
Update user documents directly in Firebase Console:

```javascript
{
  skills: ["react", "javascript", "typescript"],
  experienceLevel: "intermediate",
  preferredTrack: "frontend"
}
```

### Step 2: Seed Job Data

**Option A: Use Firebase Console**

1. Import `src/data/sampleJobs.json` into Firestore
2. Collection name: `jobs`

**Option B: Use Seeding Script**

1. Open your app in browser while logged in
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Import and run the seed function from `src/data/seedData.js`

**Option C: Manual Import**
Copy job objects from `sampleJobs.json` and add them manually to Firestore.

### Step 3: Test the Feature

1. Sign in to your app
2. Navigate to "Job Matches" in the navbar
3. View your personalized job recommendations
4. Test search and filter functionality

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Matching Weights

Edit `src/utils/matchScore.js`:

```javascript
// Change scoring weights
const skillScore = (matchedSkills.length / jobSkills.length) * 60; // Change 60
const expScore = 20; // Max experience points
const trackScore = 20; // Max track points
```

### Add New Job Fields

1. Update Firestore structure
2. Modify `JobCard` component in `JobMatchPage.jsx`
3. Update sample data in `sampleJobs.json`

### Change Match Level Thresholds

Edit `getMatchLevel()` in `src/utils/matchScore.js`:

```javascript
if (score >= 80) return "Excellent"; // Change threshold
if (score >= 60) return "Good";
// etc.
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Profile not found" error

**Solution**: User document must exist in Firestore with required fields

```javascript
{ skills: [], experienceLevel: "", preferredTrack: "" }
```

### Issue: No jobs showing

**Solution**:

1. Check if jobs collection exists in Firestore
2. Verify collection name is exactly "jobs"
3. Check Firebase rules allow read access

### Issue: Match scores all showing 0%

**Solution**:

1. Verify user profile has skills array with values
2. Check job documents have skillsRequired array
3. Skills must match (case-insensitive)

### Issue: Apply links not working

**Solution**:

1. Check `applyLinks` object exists in job document
2. Verify URLs are valid and properly formatted
3. Only links that exist will render buttons
